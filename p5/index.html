    <h1> Scrolling Proposal</h1>

    <p>Working with an article that is featured in my typography III magazine.
    <a href="http://www.hegartyonadvertising.com/">set up something like this one</a>

    Having somewhat of a character/ narrator that you follow through out the story telling it with bodies of text and images that change as you scroll up using the fixed background images in CSS to scroll over the others for a parallex scroll.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using call outs and images that line up witht he text as you scroll and a header that is fixed at the top through the whole article with a scroll tracker ont he side to show the point of the document you have come to.
