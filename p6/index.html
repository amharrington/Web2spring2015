    This vertical icon of the city is so kitschy it has become cool, and it gives a great view of the city from the top. The Observation deck is a 41 second ride to the top. As you head up, Seattle reveals its green and blue glory beneath you. Once on deck, take time to soak in the spectacular 360 degree view of Emeral City. </p>
